"Impressive vocals, and the drums punch through the mix. However though, the stutter effect didnt capture me completely, and that was the primary factor leading to my decision to pass on this song. Thank you for sending it over for consideration, though, and best wishes with the campaign.",Infinite
"Hello, hope all is good with you. Thanks a lot for sending us your track. The vocal sounds good, but the instrumental didnt fit us atm. Unfortunately we have to pass this time, sorry. We wish you the best of luck.",Infinite
"Your track features a very cool and catchy vocal! However, the energy in the instrumental is a bit too intense for our current playlist. Nonetheless, I'm confident you'll find the support this track deserves!",Infinite
"Thanks for sending this over. Really solid production here but it's a little too pop/commercial for my playlist listeners, sorry!",Infinite
"Thanks for sharing Infinite, and I definitely feel the song is how you described above. I really enjoyed the track and could see this not only thriving in a club setting but even in sync for tech/digital commercials or even a video game like GTA 6. I would recommend reaching out to club promoters or music supervisors to pitch your track as a way to further push it out there. But thank you for sharing.",Infinite
"Hey Aspen, nice to meet you and thanks for sharing this track with me. Waw this track is fire! The vocals are sick, the bass are amazing! I really like the vibes. I think the mix and the mastering could be better but otherwise everything is perfect. I suggest you send me the track once it's released so I can share it on my playlists :) Sanzach",Infinite
"Hello Aspen Jade, I overall really enjoyed the track and I felt you did a good job with the drop and structure of the track. However I found the track to be a bit too relaxed for my playlist. Thank you for sharing",Infinite
