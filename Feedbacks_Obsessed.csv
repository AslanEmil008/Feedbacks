"Hi. Thank you for sharing your song with me. I love your very beautiful relaxing musical accompaniment, everything sounds very beautiful and harmonious, your gentle voice weaves perfectly with the music and you have a unique penetrating delivery. Overall, the song is very beautiful. However, it sounds a bit soft and dreamy for my playlist, so I won't add it, sorry. I hope for your understanding. Take care and all the best to you!",Obsessed
"Brilliant melody and vocals however we feel the overall vibe of the song is too electronic pop for our playlist. We focus on upbeat indie and electro pop similar to that of Kayden on our platform. Nevertheless, a great track.",Obsessed
Really cool song! It perfectly matches our playlist. We're definitely adding it and we hope it will help you to generate loads of streams. Keep up the good work!,Obsessed
"Hi Aspen Jade, thanks for sharing your music with us. Your song ""Obsessed"" offers a nice Dance Pop type of sound. First I would like to highlight the chorus which is very well thought out and catchy. The instrumental is very good and the vocal performance is super accomplished as well. The production in general is good and it's a well done composition. Personally I wouldn't change anything, it's very good. But unfortunately I have to inform you that I won't be able to share your song because we are looking for more Indie Pop or Dream Pop projects with a more melancholic or dramatic mood and your song is more of a Dance Pop. Anyway we wish you a lot of success in your career and in your future releases. Best regards, Now Born Music",Obsessed
"Hi, good vocal part and melodies we have in this song. But the drop part didn't get our eyes this time, so we have to pass on this. For next!",Obsessed
"hello aspen, this track is just a bit too light electronic sounding for my liking and what im sharing for the falling for the bad ones playlist or even tell me what you heard playlist or so, all the best!",Obsessed
"Hi Aspen, thank you for the request. Nice work, it's a well written and produced track, congrats. Anyway, it sounds too far from my playlist targets (neo-classical music and indie folk acoustic songs). I'm passing this time, I'm sorry!",Obsessed
Great job on the vocal performance. Loved the synth production too. But the song was a bit too upbeat for our playlists.,Obsessed

"Hi, A! Hope you're well :) Digging the clean and warm tone of the production! Beautiful voice and singing too! However, we won't be able to offer a placement this time as we felt the song to have been a tad too electronic and laid-back to suit us. We tend to go for a bit more acoustic-oriented songs, with some sort of groovy drums. So, would've wanted more acoustic drums to have matched us better. Close. Still a beautiful song, though. Best of luck and hopefully another time! <3",Obsessed
"Hi Aspen, thanks for sending your track ""Obsessed"". This was a really pleasant surprise, such a nice and vibey track. Your vocals and especially the harmonies are great. The production is very tasteful and brings out the best in this song. In short, I'm a big fan. Even though I really like the track there's not much we can do for you right away since our record label and Spotify playlists are focused on Lofi and Ambient music. If you're looking for music marketing support (social ads, pitching, release management, content & format development) feel free to reach out since these are our main areas of expertise. Thanks for sending your track, keep it up and have a nice day!",Obsessed
"Hey Aspen Jade, I just listened to ""Obsessed"" and wanted to share some thoughts with you. Your track has a catchy beat and your vocals are impressive. However, after careful consideration, I've decided that it doesn't quite align with the mood and theme I'm aiming for with my playlist. Please understand that this decision is subjective and doesn't diminish the quality of your work. Keep creating and sharing your music! Best regards, Jaimy",Obsessed
"Thank you for your submission Aspen. Like the overall idea of the track as well as the idea of the instrumentation on the production end, love the soothing vibes on this one personally. Like the vocal texture as well, really unique to what we have heard recently. Sadly we really feel like the overall vocals could have been a bit more louder and upfront in the overall mix in our opinion. We really appreciate your submission but will very kindly have to pass on this one. All the best!",Obsessed

"Hey Aspen Jade ! Thanks for your sub, the track is very well produced and very emotional ! Love it ! Unfortunately, we will not be able to take the song. It is too far from what we currently looking for. More into Electro Chill stuff :) Have a great day and good luck with the promotion Pierre",Obsessed
"Hey guys, big thanks for sharing this tune! I love the professionalism and laidback vibes on this one, but I have to admit that personally I was missing a more catchy chorus hook on it... Hope this makes any sense and please don't hesitate to submit any new music in the future ðŸ˜Š",Obsessed
"the artwork is amazing and we love your beautiful voice, but we have to decline the submission, instrumentally, it's lacking conviction. Good luck",Obsessed
"Hey there! I listened to your song, and I must say, your vocals are top-notch. You've got a great voice! However, in my opinion, the song seems to lack some additional elements that could make it truly stand out. Consider experimenting with different instruments or adding some catchy hooks to make it more memorable. Keep up the good work! :)",Obsessed
"Hi! I love this track, but unfortunately your song doesn't match the vibe of my playlist. I'm looking for songs with a more slow paced, classical, romantic in my feels type of vibe. I love your work though! All the best, Abbie",Obsessed
Thanks for sharing Obsessed. You have a lovely voice and the production has a great sound. The song definitely fits the ambiance of driving in a sunset setting. I enjoyed the chorus and could see this song thriving in a coming of age film or on certain indie radio stations playlists. I would recommend reaching out to indie station managers with your track or music supervisors working on films that fit the genre of your type of music.,Obsessed

"Hi Aspen, thank you for submitting your song. I agree that this does have California sunset vibes. It has great energy, and the bass is not overpowering which keeps it calm and relatable. I really like what you did with the mix. Nice work! I think this would be great for sync. Would love to work with you to get your song into film, TV and commercials. We will email you soon.",Obsessed

"Hi Aspen Jade, Night Vibes Here! I've heard your song called ""Obsessed"" and after listening to your song, I have a few opinions, your vocals sound great, it sounds like it has a very regular melody, but there are a few things I have to consider. And I would like to apologize for not being able to add your song to my playlist titled ""Night Vibes"" because I don't think your song meets the criteria of my playlist, I think you need to add some more tonal elements to make it more interesting to the listener Thank you for sending your song to me, I really appreciate it, keep working and don't give up!",Obsessed

"Hello! really liked the song, heard some catchy stuff - as my personal option, the vocals are pretty cool! they really works for me - but some how, the instrumental does not have the same brilliance as the vocal. :-/ still curious about your next submissions! hopefully i can approve it! until then, i wising you the best of luck and success with your music! :)",Obsessed
"Lovely calm track, though not the right fit. This song has a really soothing vocal paired with chill instrumentation that gave it a nice laidback feel. However, the production leaned more towards pop than house music. Unfortunately it doesn't include the house elements we're looking for in our music selection. Thanks for sharing your work - I can tell it was well crafted. While it's not suitable for our purposes, I hope you find success placing it in the right context. Keep up the great songwriting!",Obsessed
"Hi, Thanks for sending us your track. We really like the track. Love the vocal topline and the vox stacking. The production is great, well produced and has a nice chill vibe!! We wouldn't change anything in the track, the mix, master everything is great. Looking forward to hearing more from you. Thanks, Cali Studios.",Obsessed
"Hi Aspen -- ah, this is hard. Your vocal tone is lovely, and I'm all for this dreamy, cruising energy. In truth, where it's hard is the writing. The lyrics are quite on the nose for me. Sorry I can't help with a placement here!",Obsessed

"Thanks for submitting. Really killer vocals, solid electro pop feel. Just looking for a more upbeat indie pop sound with a big hook currently. Best of luck",Obsessed
Itâ€™s a good song with a great production but the style is different to what we are used to share,Obsessed
"i like the laidback mood here very chiled but i felt that hte style of the track was a bit too close to a more ambient and ethereal poppy sound in the electronic space, howeever my electronic curation has a more gritty trap / future bass sound so ill have to pass im afraid",Obsessed
"Hey Aspen, thanks for sharing this track and congrats on your release! I appreciate reading the background on your artistry and inspiration and I like this song. The vocals are nicely delivered, the higher and lower vocals work well together, and the production creates such a cool dreamy feel. Overall production is done well and you've got a catchy electro pop song. For me, and this is subjective, it doesn't fit the style of my playlist as this is more on the romantic side of love and the song on melancholy focus on the darker/sad side of love. Would love to hear more, best of luck!",Obsessed
"Mesmerizing vocals & impressive pop-rock fusion! Intricate arrangement & indie flair showcase talent. Professional mix & polished sound resonate strongly. While current playlists seek ""catchy"" melodies, we appreciate your artistry & talent. Keep exploring & send new tracks! Thanks for sharing, good luck and best regards",Obsessed
"Hey Aspen Jade, I like the melody of your song. I also think your voice sounds very nice, but the song lacks a little bit that extra and unique. It could be a little louder from me. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to add your song to my playlist. Good luck with your song!",Obsessed
"Hey there, The song stands out with the soulful and delicate vocals and a serene house drop that accompanies afterwards. Unfortunately, the genre and style of the song is more upbeat and wouldn't fit with our indie-folk focused playlist. Thanks for sending!",Obsessed
"Hi there, thank you for sharing your music with us, we're digging the vibe on this, the song got a tuneful rhythm flow and quality. However though, considering our playlists not 100 % fitting the mood im trying to set, im afraid... , but dont discourage since this is just a matter of taste, we hope you understand. Thanks for the listen and good luck with the release.",Obsessed
"Hi Aspen! This was really close, I wanted just a tad more impact on the choruses when the house beat came in and felt a little less grabbed by the halftime trap style chorus. Kindly passing here but hope to hear more :)",Obsessed
"Hey Aspen Jade! Glad to hear your music.The vibe of this song is really resonating with us and we're enjoying the tuneful rhythm. Regrettably, male vocals didn't captivate us enough for our playlists. However, taste varies from person to person, so please don't feel disheartened. Thank you for allowing us to listen and best of luck with your release!",Obsessed
"Hi friend! Thanks for sharing with Social Rave your track. This is a great track with beautiful vocals. Perhaps the drop lacks a bit more power to better complement the rest of the track. Keep working on it. Send us more of your music, and we'll be glad to hear it. Have a nice day Aspen Jade.",Obsessed
"Hey, thanks for sending your submission. I really like the overall vibes but i am not such a big fan of the vocals. I wish you good luck and greetings",Obsessed
"Hello Aspen Jade, thank you so much for sending us your composition. It is a nice track but, honestly, It is very far from our share range and preferences. As a website focused on clubbing and on the contemporary electronic underground scene, we're looking for something different to share, something dancefloor-oriented with a strong electro, techno or house background and this is not exactly a match. I'm sorry. Thank you again, all the best and good luck.",Obsessed
"Hi Aspen, thanks for submitting Obsessed. Cool track. LOVE the production. A little to dance for the Pop Polaroid Playlist, so we will not be adding this one. Wishing you the best of luck though, it's a great track.",Obsessed

"Hey Aspen, Love this and can totally hear the sunset drive vibes for sure. Cool stuff and really well produced. I'm afraid that it's just not a match for the introspective, sad, cinematic sounds of our page (think Sufjan, Bon Iver, etc). Sorry! Thanks for sharing though and all the best!",Obsessed
"hey there! It's truly a fantastic piece of work, exceptionally well-produced, and showcases your outstanding ability of creating great chill & deep house music ðŸŽµ Regrettably, your type featured more of commercial/mainstream style, than some instrumental melodic/deep house tunes (artists examples: MALIAN, Sultan + Shepard, Ben BÃ¶hmer) we're looking for our main list. no offense, just our honest tkae. we want to say that your dedication to this style is evident, and we're excited to see how your sound evolves in the future!",Obsessed
"First of all we want to thank you for the opportunity to give feedback on your music. The first aspect of the track that caught my attention was the voice you have. It sounds super professional and very well worked, apart from the talent that you have. On top of that, at the beginning I noticed an effect in your voice that in my opinion gives it a special touch and a very noticeable effect. The song transmits a lot of feeling and the combination of the very professional voice, the stylish instrumental and the very proffunate lyrics manages to send a very clear message. I really like the chorus, I think the positive thing is that many people who are in that phase of falling in love can identify with the message of this very obsessed with you . Finally I have decided not to share it on my social networks as I think they do not share the same style. In any case I wish you the best in your musical career and good luck for the future!",Obsessed

"""Obsessed"" by Aspen Jade is a compelling composition that delves into the theme of fixation with a unique musical flair. While the song showcases notable strengths, there are certain elements that, when refined, could amplify its overall impact. The production quality of the track is commendable, offering a well-crafted sonic backdrop that suits the theme. However, there's an opportunity to explore a more expansive dynamic range. Introducing moments of subtle build-ups or drops could add emotional depth, creating a more engaging listening experience and emphasizing the intensity of the fixation portrayed in the song. Lyrically, ""Obsessed"" presents an intriguing narrative, but there's room for greater lyrical precision. Some verses could benefit from more vivid imagery or metaphorical language to intensify the emotional connection. Strengthening the lyrical depth could enhance the storytelling aspect of the song, allowing listeners to immerse themselves more fully in the theme of obsession. Aspen Jade's vocal delivery is expressive and well-suited to the song's mood. However, there are moments where vocal phrasing could be further refined for a smoother flow. Addressing these nuances through careful vocal control or post-production adjustments could enhance the overall cohesion of the vocal performance. The song's structure is well-conceived, guiding the listener through the emotional landscape. Yet, there's an opportunity to experiment with arrangement to maintain interest. Introducing subtle variations or unexpected shifts in instrumentation could add an extra layer of intrigue, contributing to the overall complexity of the composition. In conclusion, ""Obsessed"" by Aspen Jade is a captivating piece with a distinctive theme. By exploring a more expansive dynamic range, refining lyrical precision, addressing vocal phrasing, and experimenting with arrangement, the song could reach new artistic heights. This is the reason why I decided not to feature the song. Nevertheless, we appreciate your submission and encourage continued exploration and refinement in your musical endeavors.",Obsessed
