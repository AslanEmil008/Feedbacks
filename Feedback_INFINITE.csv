"Super chill vocals, with an impressive performance. However though, I struggled a bit with the stuttered melodies in the drop, so unfortunately I have to pass on this occasion. Thanks for a cool listen, though, and best wishes with the release.",INFINITE
"Hello Aspen :) Hope you having a great day ! I've listened to your song and i kinda liked the vibe, i think this is a suitable song to played to be dreamy,dance! Liked your style by the way. You made a good song! I would want to share but unhappily i am looking for energy pop simlar to Dua Lipa,Taylor swift vibes nowadays . Take care !",INFINITE
"Dear Aspen Jade, Thanks a lot for reaching us. Vocals are really smooth and melodic here, instrumental part sounds clean and atmospheric here but overall we are looking for some chill and vibey R&B tracks. Best regards, La Belle Musique",INFINITE

"hey, thanks for sending :) I like how you described it as a ""make out at the club"" track. I think that's an apt description and your voice will really speak to audiences. I was a bit dissapointed by the production though. the stutter house style is a bit overdone in my opinion. I think the drops were good, but the verses felt a bit too dark and empty to me. I'll give this a narrow pass but wish you all the best :)",INFINITE
"Hello, we only accept actual 'demos' for release consideration as stated in our profile here on Groover. We are a publishing house and hence cannot consider self-released music for marketing/publishing. Thank you Dario | Plasmapool PRO-TUNES distribution www.pro-tunes.com",INFINITE
"Thank you for sharing your track. I really like the electro-pop elements and the vocals, but I feel that the instrumental changes in rhythm in some sections don't quite fit with the overall flow of the song. This is just a matter of personal taste",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen, thanks for sending your music, lovely production! in my personal opinion i would like to suggest to go out for the classic modern electronic pop because i can feel really well your good preparation and the vocal talent, Please get my comment like a suggestion, However i'm looking for something more instrumental for my showcase, I would like to wish you the best :)",INFINITE
"hey over there, thanks for sharing your art with us today, have to say impressive tune for us with a tight mix. unfortunately this can be less pop oriented with the vocal we need to say.. we wish you all the best",INFINITE
"First of all, we would like to thank you for the opportunity to give feedback to your music. I find the rhythm from the beginning the very electronic and dynamic introduction and transmitting a lot of desire to party, but without lag. I like the way theme of connecting with the public using simple lyric and above all a unique style that connects very well with the new generations. The essence of pop that it has and dance is very attractive and more because it helps. Transmit that feeling with the public. We have finally decided not to share it on our social networks since we believe that they do not share the same style, in any case we wish you the best for the future and good luck in your musical career!",INFINITE
"The song has a vocal that, from the first moments, captures the listener's attention. The way the elements intertwine, creating a totally danceable atmosphere, shows a great mastery of the technique. The music has a flawless construction, but without managing to bring something that is relatively new to our ears. We felt a certain predictability in the sound",INFINITE
Hey thanks for reaching out! The production of your track demonstrates an exceptional level of quality. The attention to detail and craftsmanship in every aspect of the production is truly impressive. Hope to hear more music from u in the future!,INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade, thanks for sending this in! Nice groove, I like the sound design, also of the FX. The vocals however are too commercial sounding for my rather instrumental selection of tracks. Cool stuff though, good luck with the release <3",INFINITE
"Hello Aspen Jade, Thanks for sending your music into us curators here at Groover. I've been listening through to ""Infinite."" I like the direction you're going in, and I appreciate the style of the vocals; they feel very current and fit well with the Electro Pop genre. If you don't mind, I'd like to make a couple of points about the mix that I noticed. The vocal performance is good, and the 'slight mumble' style gives the music an attitude and edge. However, if I were mixing this, I'd bring the vocal out more, letting it stand and be bolder, sitting right at the forefront. Although a lot of club systems are still in mono, having a good stereo mix is essential. I noticed a lot of sounds sitting in the center of the mix. You could really bring out some more interesting elements by panning the non-stereo sounds to different points in the stereo field, which will also help separate things away from the vocal. In the low mids, there's a lot of information that, to my ears, needs to be tamed a touch more to generate a bit of clarity. I also noticed there's a reverse low end that comes in at points, particularly around 52 seconds, repeating. While I like this element, it creates a lot of mud and detracts from the bass. As an experiment, it might be worth seeing what it sounds like without the reverse bass at moments when everything's playing. These are just my thoughts listening on my monitor sets with fresh, independent ears. Please feel free to ignore any of the above if you disagree—they are intended to help and provide food for thought for future recordings or remixes. For the above reasons, I won't be sharing, but keep doing what you're doing. You are talented and have everything there; just a few tweaks and your music will really take off. Kind regards, Darren Stone",INFINITE
"Hi there, Thank you for sharing your music with us. Appreciate the energy/impact of the beats. There's a good synergy between the elements. However, this style has too much of a pop influence for our selection. Kindly passing on this one! Best regards,",INFINITE
"Hi Aspen Jade. Fun track. I had a good time listening, there's a pretty strong groove to the drums and percussion elements here and I liked the driving feel of the rhythm. Not super fond of the more choppy vocal samples for my house playlists personally. Good luck with the release though, and with your future projects! Cheers, Bregt // Alpas Records",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen, I'm happy to share the Spotify Playlist with your song: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6K56BvmDW3aGGzjYjgdEJt , To help spread the word, please follow the playlist and/or share it on your Instagram Stories. This support really means a lot! Let's stay in touch on Instagram too! You can find me at https://www.instagram.com/futureleomusic , I’d love to chat about future promo opportunities. Thanks so much and have an awesome week ahead!",INFINITE
"Hi there! Top quality production and mix . Really loved the soothing vocals and catchy melodies .However for our EDM playlist we are looking for a bit more energy in the drop and more leads action . Rest ,the track has got some real good potential. Good luck! can't wait to hear more tracks from you.",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen, thanks for sharing the track ""INFINITE."" Positive vibes perfect for the club, love the style of production, but unfortunately the style of music isn't a great fir for our label or Spotify playlists at this time. Wishing you all the best with the release.",INFINITE
I really like the research of sounds in this track. You've created a good fusion of different genres of music but we're looking for something more pop sad,INFINITE
"Hello, hope all is great with you. Thanks for sending the track. This beat is amazing, didnt like the way the drop sounds on the part of the elements used. Unfortunately have to pass this time, wish you the best of luck",INFINITE
"Hey there! Thank you so much for reaching out! We loved the groovy beat of this song. The drums and the percussions sound so clean and we've also liked the fresh synths that were used. The sound fx are completing the scenery very nice and we've enjoyed listening to this tune, but unfortunately, we feel that the melodic line is not really the mood we're looking for our current playlists, so we will have to kindly decline it. Best wishes!",INFINITE

"Hey there. Cool song with a strong bassline! I love the atmosphere but unfortunately the vocal is not a 100% match for my lists that's why I kindly have to pass. All the best, Deepium",INFINITE
"Hello, Thank you for sharing your music with us. I’ve had the opportunity to listen to your recent submission and appreciate the creativity and effort you’ve put into it. Your song demonstrates strong musicality and talent, with compelling elements in both the composition and arrangement. However, in my assessment, the energy level of the track doesn't quite align with the tone we're currently curating for our playlists. While your song is well-crafted and enjoyable, its energetic vibe may not fit the specific mood we're aiming for at this time. Thank you once again for your submission. I encourage you to continue refining your artistic direction and exploring different emotional nuances in your music. Your dedication to your craft is evident, and we look forward to potentially exploring more of your work in the future. Best regards.",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade, thanks for sending this one our way. We're enjoying the vocal and club aesthetic in the sound design. That said, our current round of dance playlists lean further into funky or groovy disco House. I hope the release goes well!",INFINITE
"Hi AJ -- I apologize, great late-night cruising energy, but this is quite pumpy, quick, and processed for what I do. I'm more bare, organic, sleepy. Sorry I can't help with a placement here!",INFINITE
"Hi Aspen Jade! The styling and bass sound good overall. Unfortunately, we won't be able to include your song in the playlist because it lacks a more danceable rhythm. We need songs that encourage the audience to dance. We appreciate your understanding and hope you can present us with another proposal.",INFINITE
Thanks for sending this. I love the vibe and originality of it. Will add to our Lounge Hits playlist.,INFINITE
Hi! Thanks for sharing your song i really liked it. Unfortunately the vibe of your song doesn't perfectly match and it's close to house music so i kindly have to pass.,INFINITE
Hi! Thanks for sharing your song i really liked it. Unfortunately the vibe and the style of your song don't perfectly match what i am looking for so i kindly have to pass. Keep it up.,INFINITE

"Hi! Appreciate you taking a minute to submit your work! What I loved in the song : - the singing is really good i love the emotion transmitted - the idea is really nice good work! The minuses for my personal taste and what might help you in the future to have a better product : - the stutters felt a bit too tiring at some point and did not click entirely with me - the master needed better overall loudness imo Anxious to hear more , cheers !",INFINITE
"Hi! It's an interesting creation with a driving and deep beat, the vocal sounds good for the electro style but sadly I'm not really into the reverb of the track. Thanks for submitting and all the best ;)",INFINITE
"Hello and thanks for sending us your music. Not a bad track in general, but indeed pretty far from the styles we have in our playlists. Unfortunately we don't have an audience for this. Sorry but we have to pass. Best of luck!",INFINITE
"Hi Jade, I really like your universe. We can continue the talk on instagram for you to send me demos? I'd like this track, i want to listen to more! Valentin.",INFINITE
"The song ""INFINITE"" by Aspen Jade likely offers a captivating and expansive sound. However, it doesn’t quite fit the cohesive style and energy we're curating for our playlist at this time. While it's not suitable for our playlist, it demonstrates creativity and potential. Keep developing your sound and exploring new musical directions—you're on the right track!",INFINITE
"Bonjour Aspen Jade, Belle proposition, j'aime l'ambiance envoutante et sensuelle du morceaux. Les placements de voix sont aérique et laisse bien respirer la prod. La voix est vraiment parfaite pour ce genre de prod! l'effet stutter house rajoute une belle identité a l'ensemble Pour ma part j'ai juste besoin de sonorités plus violente en terme de bassline lors du refrain ( slap bass) pour mes playlists actuellement Je passe donc pour cette fois mais bravo a toi c'est un super morceaux :)",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade Thank you so much for sharing your track ""INFINITE"". I got exactly that, which is a win-win! I really enjoyed the cadence and paired production as from the initial play, it puts you in a trance. Then when the beat drops, you can't help but get sucked in! Your vocals are so crisp and clean and catch the beat beautifully. It's high energy and pulsating production, makes the release for a great listening experience. This is a great track to be spun throughout the club and expresses what many women feel in that moment. Its expressive and evokes emotions related to the record. Well done! Enjoyed everything from start to finish! I'd be happy to highlight your club-heavy hit on my site, Minnee Movement Media. In doing so, i'll be sure to circle back with the live link when ready! Thank you so much again!",INFINITE

"Hello, nice song with nice atmospheres, loved the vibe on it, we are going to pass this time because we dont feel the vocals for a feature because they dont fit the current mood of our playlists, but dont discourage since this is just a matter of taste and music is very subjective. Thanks for sending and hope to listen more music from you in the future.",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade! Glad to hear your music.The vibe of this song is really resonating with us and we're enjoying the tuneful rhythm. Regrettably, drop vibe didn't captivate us enough for our playlists. However, taste varies from person to person, so please don't feel disheartened. Thank you for allowing us to listen and best of luck with your release!",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade! Thanks for submitting with us. It is a good song overall and we're digging the vibe, nice basslines and cool synths too. Unfortunately, we are going to pass this time because vocals vibe doesn't fit quite enough for what we are looking for our playlist mood. Hope to listen to more of your music in the future, good luck with your release.",INFINITE
"Hey there, thanks for your submission! Your production work is solid, but it doesn't quite resonate with us / catch us enough to be feature in our playlists. It's really just a matter of personal taste, not a judgment on the quality, so dont be discouraged. Best of luck with your release, though!",INFINITE
"Hello, amazing track, loved the vibe on it. The production is solid, but sadly, I am going to pass this time because the song didn't catch me enough for a feature, feeling this doesn't quite suit what I am looking for. But of course, that's a personal matter of taste. Have an amazing day and best of luck with your future projects.",INFINITE
"Hi Aspen. Thanks for submitting this track. It's a dreamy and relaxing piece of music, well supported by bass and sensitive vocals. I prefer a sharper and more exciting sound. Have a good day!",INFINITE
"Thank you for sharing your track and the stunning visuals! The composition is exceptional, and it’s clear you’ve put a lot of effort and creativity into this piece. While it may not align perfectly with my station’s current direction, I genuinely appreciate your dedication and passion. Keep pushing your artistic boundaries and exploring new ideas—I’m eager to see what you create next. Your talent and hard work are truly inspiring!",INFINITE
"Hi Aspen Jade ,Nice to e-meet you and thanks for sharing your song. Your music is well-produced and of high quality. Love your … and vibe and mix of genres. However, it doesn't align with the style of my playlist. Unfortunately, I don't have a playlist that fits your genre at this time. It’s too mainstream for our lists, we are looking for something more instrumental and chill (down tempo). Thanks for your understanding and support. Best regards,",INFINITE
"I love the stutter concept in this track. The production is really cool. It's an excellent fusion of electro pop, but it has a bit too much energy and groove for our soft mellow chill house playlist. Otherwise, it's a really cool song with great vocals.",INFINITE
"Unfortunately, this is not my cup of tea at all. I'm looking for something more soulful with more melody and less effects on the vocals. This might work at the clubs, anway.",INFINITE
"cool synths in the drop, it feels everything goes bouncy. it has a vibe, but unfortunately it's too chill for my playlist. Keep it up, good song!",INFINITE
"Hi, Aspen Jade, thanks for your submission. The song is energetic and delivers an immersive vocal performance that makes the song smooth and engaging. The melody is dynamic and the beats are rhythmic. However, the track maybe shows strong Pop aesthetic that may be apart from our current playlist aesthetic, possibly playlists with some more Pop vibes will be a better fit. I hope next time we can work together with a track that suits us better.",INFINITE
"hi! Thanks for sharing this song with me :) I enjoyed a lot the beautiful energy and your captivating voice, its very sensual and expressive, congratulations!! But unfortunately I'm aiming for different vibes and moods, i focus on more happy oriented songs. I'm sorry! Ill have to pass All the best with your campaign! Keep it up!",INFINITE
"Really great work on this but it's just a bit more in the dance and electronic world than we tend to share on our ambient and experimental blog. Best of luck, just not quite our thing. We are sure this will find plenty of ears this year.",INFINITE
"Hello, Very good track, love it. Is it you the singer ? I will share to our Artistic director. Cheers,",INFINITE
"Hi Aspen Jade, Thank you for sharing your song with me. Unique beat, love it a lot. However, I have to be honest that it doesn't quite align with the vibe I'm curating for my electronic music playlist because I noticed the abrupt transitions create an inconsistent flow for me personally. And I'm currently focusing on tracks that have a more traditional deep house feel. We are mainly look for artists more adjacent to Ame and Rodriguez Jr. However, I want to emphasize that it sounds really amazing. I see and feel how hard you worked on it and the idea you tried to convey. It's so damn cool.",INFINITE
Heres a link to the playlist I added you too: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3n8oMzVU6JLitiIgROnDjx?si=3e55b44e07b24b01,INFINITE
"Hey, thanks for submitting your track. The track is well produced with qualitative elements used. It sounds catchy and punchy with a great artistic direction but it is too pop experimental for us. All the best!",INFINITE
"Hey! thank you so much for your submission, I like the chord progression, the drums sound good in the mix and I like the atmosphere in general but maybe I feel the track is not that catchy or memorable enough to me to be honest so I'm afraid I'll pass this time.",INFINITE
"The vocals are fantastic, and blend perfectly into the deep atmosphere of the song. However though, the stutter melodies in the drop didn't capture me enough to cover it, and that is the main reason I have to pass. Thank you for sending it over for consideration though and best wishes with the release.",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen, thanks for reaching out. I listened to your song and I enjoyed the chorus at 0:31, with the stutter vocals and synth used. However, mainly due to the lack of a more predominant and deep kind of chorus (with a more powerful type of drums), I don´t feel it matches 100% my playlist. Hope you understand and have a great weekend!",INFINITE
"Great potential on this tune across the board. However, the chorus didn’t really stand out to us when compared to other submissions sent over this week.",INFINITE
"Hey there ! Great track, very well produced and performed. But when it comes to style, it's a bit too far off from the color of my playlists at the moment, so I will pass this time, sorry about that ! But keep up the GREAT music !!",INFINITE

"Such a bop! Huge atmosphere with room for every texture and vibrant synth melting really nice in the mix, but our style is more commercial tuned. Thanks for sharing!",INFINITE
"Hi, Aspen Jade. Thank you for sending your track for review. This one gives a chill-cool vibe to its listeners. However, I’m looking for some variation when it comes to music production. Due to this, I will not be adding this one to the playlist, sorry. I appreciate you as an artist because of your passion for music and I can’t wait to hear your future releases. Fighting!",INFINITE
"Hey, all though the song is good, for my playlists is a bit too chill and calm. Sorry and good luck with promoting the song! looking forward for your next releases",INFINITE
"Hello, thank you for sharing your song! The song is so attractive that I can't stop moving my head! For me, this was an appealing and entertaining song. As I listened, the arrangement appeared dense and unconnected. Despite respecting the work and imagination put into it, I did not find the song to be suitable for my musical preferences. This is just my viewpoint; others may disagree. It is clear that you have potential; continue writing songs. I wish you much luck in your musical career! Warm greetings and success!",INFINITE
"Hey Aspen Jade, thanks for sending out your music to me. Congrats for the quality of the production, it's really pleasant to listen! Currently it will not fit with my actual artistic direction because it's a bit too much ""commercial"" for me as a more underground house music Dj but it's very personal, keep up the great work, hope to listen some more soon, cheers!",INFINITE

"Hi, Thanks for sending us your track. It's great to hear from you again. We love the track!! It's a vibe and really gets you going. We really like the stutters, it's well done in the right places! We have some feedback for you that we feel would help improve the track, hope this helps - - The low end can be tighter - The drums can hit harder and glue better with the bass - You can cut out some mud from the track Best of luck :) Thanks, Cali Studios",INFINITE
Thanks for sending this over. Tight production here. Nice vocals on it but overall it feels a touch too commercial for our playlist. Sorry!,INFINITE

"Hey Jade, nice to meet you and thanks for sharing this one with me. The vibes are pretty good, the drop is insane, just love it! The only negative point are the mix and the mastering. Try to have a cleaner and fresher mix. About the mastering, the low end is not good enough, try to improve this side too! Find the good balance between the drums and the bassline! Otherwise you have lot of talent so keep going! Feel free to send me more demos in the future ;) Best regards, Sanzach",INFINITE
