"Hi Aspen Jade, Thank you for sharing ""Searching"" with us. Altogether, I like how minimalist the soundscape is and how its sticks with the likes of its steady bass beat and bubbly synth sounds. However, the modulated vocal interlude around the 1:24 mark doesn't sit right with me. For example, the splintered, skipping vocals towards the beginning serve the purpose of kicking off the rest of the track. Thanks again and best of luck with your music.",Searching

"Hi! I appreciate this new song so much! Itâ€™s again very energetic but not really the vibe that Iâ€™m looking for, which are more sensual romantic songs.",Searching
"I loved the kind of vibe and energy you went for in this song. Though the lyrics were amazing and how I loved it, the background percussion especially seemed to be a bit repetitive, for me personally. So sorry I couldn't share this, do keep sharing more music!",Searching
"The vocals are incredible and rich on the song, but to be honest, the melody is not memorable here. Good luck",Searching
"Hello, thank you for this suggestion. Beautiful world with a sublime pop voice. I really liked the direction. But it's true that it's a bit too pop for me. It's a shame because it's really well produced but I'll have to pass this time. All the same, I wish you all the best for the future.",Searching
"Thank you for sharing your track and the incredible visuals! Your hard work and creativity are truly evident. Although this track may not perfectly align with my stationâ€™s current direction, I genuinely admire your dedication and artistry. Keep exploring your unique sound and pushing your creative boundariesâ€”I look forward to seeing where your journey takes you!",Searching
"Hey Aspen Jade, thanks for your submission! I like the track a lot, itÂ´s creating a nice and positive vibe. Well done! Also the vocals are sweet and I like your overall variations throughout the song. In my oppinion the mix could be a bit more upfront and harder hitting, but thatÂ´s just what I personally prefer ;) Some kind of catchy hook element (like a sax/trp melody) could have been nice on top of everything too. Still have to pass this one, because IÂ´m not looking for vocal tracks in my playlist, sorry. Looking forward to your next releases. Keep up the good vibes, Slo ðŸ’š",Searching
"Hi, thanks a lot for your submission! Beautiful track here, great vocal skills and beautiful voice. Sadly I accept only instrumental lofi tracks on my playlist. This is why I have to decline your submission. Keep in mind that this doesnâ€™t detract from the quality of your song, it is just a matter of artistic choices. Hope you understand. I'm looking forward to hear more of your music in the future ! Have a nice day.",Searching
"Hello, Thank you for sharing your music with us. I've had the opportunity to listen to your recent submission and appreciate the effort and creativity you've put into your work. Your song is well-crafted with strong musicality and engaging elements in both the melody and lyrics. It showcases your talent and dedication as a songwriter. However, in my personal assessment, there's a consideration regarding the mood we're currently curating for our playlists. While your song is of high quality, there's a slight mismatch in the emotional tone that we're aiming for at this time. Thank you once again for your submission. I encourage you to continue exploring different emotional nuances in your music and refining your artistic direction. Your talent shines through, and we look forward to potentially exploring more of your work in the future. Best regards.",Searching
"Your voice and the atmosphere of the track sound amazing. Personally, the vocal melody didnâ€™t captivate me enough on this one, but I can definitely hear the quality of the song. Appreciate the submission. Wish you the best with the release.",Searching
